## 1. Enrollment Trends and Patterns

### 1.1 Overall Enrollment Trends
- **Application Volume**: Applications decreased from **19,866 (2016)** to **11,491 (2021)**, with the sharpest drops after 2017 (down **16.6%** from 2017 to 2018 and **9.0%** from 2018 to 2019).
- **Enrollment Volumes**: Enrollments remained comparatively stable (between **2,735 and 4,061** students per year), indicating that while the funnel is narrower, the university is enrolling a similar absolute number of students.
- **Enrollment Rates**: Overall yield (applications → enrollments) increased from **19.5% (2016)** to a high of **26.5% (2020)**, before easing slightly to **23.8% (2021)**.
- **Key Insight**: Despite a shrinking applicant pool, the institution has become more effective at converting applicants to enrolled students, partially offsetting volume declines.

### 1.2 Year-over-Year Changes
- **Growth Patterns**: Applications dipped modestly between **2016 and 2017** (−4.0%) and more substantially between **2017 and 2018** (−16.6%); yield increased most strongly between **2018 (21.5%) and 2019 (25.3%)** and again into **2020 (26.5%)**.
- **Academic Profile Stability**: First-term GPA for enrolled students averages between **2.51 and 2.79** on a 4.0 scale, peaking in **2019 (2.79)** before softening to **2.51 in 2021**, suggesting some recent pressure on academic preparation.
- **Recommendation**: Recruitment strategy should address the structural decline in applications, while retention and academic support should focus on cohorts entering after 2019, where average first-term GPA shows downward drift.

### 1.3 College-Level Enrollment Trends
- **Top Performing Colleges**: Over the full period, the largest applicant volumes are in **College of Arts & Sciences (37,737 applications)** and **College of Engineering & Polymer Science (18,696 applications)**, followed closely by **College of Health & Human Sciences (17,968 applications)**.
- **Specialized Units**: **The University of Akron (general/undeclared)** accounts for **3,798 applications**, while **College of Applied Science & Technology** and **Provost** units collectively represent a smaller share but higher-need populations.
- **Strategic Insight**: Arts & Sciences and Engineering & Polymer Science together account for well over half of all applications, and should continue to be central in capacity planning, while Business and Health & Human Sciences offer strong growth and diversification opportunities.

- **Support Needs**: These patterns suggest a need for college-specific first-generation programming, especially in Health & Human Sciences, Applied Science & Technology and Provost-managed programs.

### 2.4 Financial Need Indicators
- **Pell Eligibility by College**:
  - **Highest Pell eligibility** appears in the **Provost portfolio (46.1%)**, **College of Applied Science & Technology (35.6%)**, and **Health & Human Sciences (32.3%)**.
  - **Engineering & Polymer Science (23.2%)** and **Business (25.9%)** are notably lower, though still reflect substantial need.
- **Insight**: Financial need is not uniform across the institution; aid strategy should be differentiated, with particular attention to colleges and programs serving 1-in-3 or more Pell-eligible students.

## 6. Retention and Student Success

### 6.1 Overall Retention Rates
- **Data Availability**: In this synthetic extract, the coded 1-year and 2-year retention flags are not populated (all values are 0), so meaningful retention rates cannot be computed.

### 6.2 Retention by College
- **Current Dataset**: Because the retention flags are uniformly zero across all colleges in the synthetic data, calculated college-level retention rates are also zero.
- **Recommended Use**: The existing retention dashboards and SQL are structurally correct and ready to consume real retention data; they should be re-run against production data to identify true high-performing and at-risk programs.
